# 🛡️ Linux, Shell & Bash for Cybersecurity

## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases my **hands-on cybersecurity practice** using **Linux**, **Shell**, and **Bash scripting**.  
It focuses on **defensive security**, **system visibility**, and **automation techniques** commonly used in **Security Operations Centers (SOC)** and **blue-team environments**.

The projects and scripts here demonstrate how lightweight Linux tools can support:
- Incident triage
- Log analysis
- System hardening
- Operational monitoring
- Threat detection workflows

---

## 🎯 Cybersecurity Learning Objectives
- Analyze system and application logs using shell tools
- Automate repetitive security tasks with Bash
- Understand Linux permissions, users, and processes from a security perspective
- Detect suspicious behavior through command-line analysis
- Practice security-minded scripting aligned with real-world SOC workflows

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Linux (Ubuntu / Debian-based systems)
- Bash / Shell scripting
- Core utilities: `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `find`
- Process & network tools: `ps`, `top`, `netstat`, `ss`, `lsof`
- Git & GitHub
- Terminal-based analysis

---

## 🔍 Security-Focused Use Cases
- 📊 **Log Analysis & Parsing**  
  Identify errors, anomalies, and unusual access patterns from structured logs.

- 🔁 **Security Automation**  
  Automate backups, permission checks, and system audits using Bash.

- 🔐 **Access & Permission Auditing**  
  Inspect file permissions, ownership, and user configurations for misconfigurations.

- 🚨 **Operational Security Monitoring**  
  Track running processes, network connections, and system behavior.
